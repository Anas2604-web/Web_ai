💡 Why I Built Converso
I wanted to challenge myself to ship a full-stack AI SaaS product - not just a demo.
This project pushed me into:

🔥 Real-time audio streaming with AI

🔐 Subscription management with Clerk + Stripe

🧠 Database logic with Supabase

🎨 Clean, scalable frontend design

⚡ Monitoring production apps with Sentry

It’s more than just a project - it’s a learning journey turned product.
